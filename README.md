# 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel Nadim Ghantous  

🎓 BS in Information Technology graduate | 📊 Aspiring Data Analyst | 💻 Future Web Developer

## 🌟 About Me  
I'm passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building solutions that improve efficiency.  
With hands-on experience in **data reporting, automation, and visualization**, I’ve worked with tools like **Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python** to support decision-making and streamline workflows.  

Alongside data, I’m advancing my **web development skills (JavaScript, Laravel, React)** to merge analytics and development, creating impactful applications.  

Outside of work, I’ve been serving since 2020 as a **Multimedia Staff** in our church, handling data processes, reporting systems, creative media support, and basic IT troubleshooting.
